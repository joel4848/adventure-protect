Add protection to:

Brewing stands
Placed musical instruments
Note blocks
Jukeboxes
Armour stands (preventing remove, place and replace, under separate config variants)
paintings (break)
shulker boxes (including the coloured variants - under one config option)


Add exceptions via the exceptionator for:

Barrels
Shulkers (including the coloured variants)
Armour stands

Yes please! Please do all of the following:

1. Add functionality to prevent players in adventure mode from:

- Punching paintings that are placed on walls (as a player in adventure mode can punch paintings, which destroys them and drops them as an item)
- Interacting with brewing stands
- Interacting with note blocks
- Interacting with jukeboxes
- Interacting with decorated pots (because they can right-click a decorated pot and it'll place the item they're holding into the pot, and then they can't get it out!)
- Removing items from armour stands
- Placing items onto armour stands
- Replacing items on armour stands
- Opening shulker boxes (including all coloured variants)
- Interacting with the following things added by the mod 'xercamusic' when they're placed as blocks in the world:
    Drum Kit (xercamusic:drum_kit); Piano (xercamusic:piano); Music Box (xercamusic:music_box); Metronome (xercamusic:metronome)

2. Add config options for all of these; there should be separate config options for armour stands for removing/placing/replacing items, but shulker boxes/colour variants can all go under one config option

3. Add more exceptions - you'll note that the mod has an item called the exceptionator; if you shift-right-click on a chest holding the exceptionator it renames it to 'Adventure Chest' and says "Added adventure protection exception to chest" - if the chest was already called Adventure Chest then it clears the custom name and says "Removed adventure protection exception from chest"
